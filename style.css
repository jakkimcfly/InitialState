Description: InitialState is the starter WordPress Theme. I've carefully constructed the most clean and useful theme possible for designers and web developers to use as a base to build websites for clients or to build completely custom themes from scratch. For support and suggestions, go to: https://jakkimcfly.github.io or https://github.com/jakkimcfly/InitialState. If you're creating your own theme or client project, open up all files and do a "Find and Replace All in All Files" on the word "initialstate" with your own slug and prefix. You may delete license file and any other file(s) before starting your project. Thank you.
